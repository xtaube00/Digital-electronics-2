1. Fill in the following table and enter the number of bits and numeric range for the selected data types defined by C.

   | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-- |
   | `uint8_t`  | 8 | 0, 1, ..., 255 | Unsigned 8-bit integer |
   | `int8_t`   | 8 | -128 to +127 | Signed 8-bit integer (char) |
   | `uint16_t` | 16 | 0 to 65 535 | Unsigned 16-bit integer |
   | `int16_t`  | 16 | âˆ’32 768 to +32 767 | Signed  16-bit integer |
   | `float`    | 32 | -3.4e+38, ..., 3.4e+38 | Single-precision floating-point |
   | `void`     | 0 | 0 | "No return value" |
